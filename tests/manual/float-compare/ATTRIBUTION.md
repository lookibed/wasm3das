# float-compare fixture

Float hash module built from Spider's own C sources (AGPL-3.0).
No third-party upstream.


## Origin

Fixture taken from the [Spider](https://github.com/lookibed/Spider) project
(upstream: https://github.com/SovereignSatellite/Spider), folder
`tests/manual/float-compare/generated/`. Spider itself is licensed under AGPL-3.0;
the wasm module glue (`module.c`, `shim.c`) is Spider's work and is AGPL-3.0.

This copy contains only the compiled `.wasm` module; see the Spider
repository for build sources and harnesses.
